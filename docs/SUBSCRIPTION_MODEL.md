## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Pricing Model

**Seat-Based Pricing**: Only **PSYCHOLOGIST** users count as paid seats.

- **TENANT_ADMIN**: Does NOT count as seat (1 free admin per clinic)
- **PSYCHOLOGIST**: Counts as 1 seat (billable user)
- **ASSISTANT**: Does NOT count as seat (unlimited assistants)

### Why This Model?

1. **Revenue aligned with value**: Psychologists generate revenue (sessions)
2. **Easy to understand**: "Pay per psychologist" is simple messaging
3. **Scalable**: Clinics can add support staff without cost penalty
4. **Predictable**: Clinics know exactly what they'll pay

## 👥 SEAT COUNTING RULES

### What Counts as a Seat?

```
SEAT = User with role PSYCHOLOGIST AND status = ACTIVE
```

### Detailed Rules

| Role | Counts as Seat? | Cost | Limit |
|------|-----------------|------|-------|
| **TENANT_ADMIN** | ❌ No | Free | 1 per clinic (hardcoded) |
| **PSYCHOLOGIST** | ✅ Yes | Paid | Plan-dependent |
| **ASSISTANT** | ❌ No | Free | Unlimited |

### Seat Calculation Examples

**Example 1: Small Clinic**
- 1 Admin (TENANT_ADMIN)
- 3 Psychologists (PSYCHOLOGIST, ACTIVE)
- 2 Assistants (ASSISTANT)
- **Billable Seats**: 3

**Example 2: Deactivated Users**
- 1 Admin (TENANT_ADMIN)
- 5 Psychologists (PSYCHOLOGIST, ACTIVE)
- 2 Psychologists (PSYCHOLOGIST, INACTIVE)
- 3 Assistants (ASSISTANT)
- **Billable Seats**: 5 (inactive users don't count)

### Seat Status Lifecycle

```
INVITED → ACTIVE → INACTIVE → DELETED
   ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓
  Free     Counted    Free    Free
```

**Key Points**:
1. **INVITED** users don't count until they accept and become ACTIVE
2. **INACTIVE** users are "soft deleted" and don't count
3. **DELETED** users are permanently removed
4. Reactivating an INACTIVE user requires available seat capacity

## 📋 BUSINESS RULES

### 1. Upgrade Rules

#### Automatic Upgrades
- **NOT ALLOWED**: No auto-upgrades without explicit user action
- **Reason**: Pricing changes require user consent

#### Manual Upgrades

**BASIC → PRO**:
- ✅ Allowed anytime
- Prorated credit for remaining BASIC period
- Immediately unlock PRO features
- Can add 2nd psychologist immediately
- Email confirmation sent

**PRO → CUSTOM**:
- ✅ Requires sales call (contact form)
- Annual contract negotiation
- Migration assistance included
- No self-service upgrade

**Seat Addition (within PRO)**:
- ✅ Instant seat addition
- Prorated charge for current billing period
- New psychologist can be invited immediately
- Auto-billing on next cycle

#### Proration Logic

```typescript
// Example: BASIC (€29/mo) → PRO (€79/mo) with 15 days left
const daysRemaining = 15;
const daysInMonth = 30;
const basicRefund = (29 / 30) * 15 = €14.50;
const proCharge = (79 / 30) * 15 = €39.50;
const netCharge = €39.50 - €14.50 = €25.00;

// Customer pays €25 today, then €79/mo on next billing cycle
```

### 2. Downgrade Rules

#### BASIC ← PRO

**Allowed IF**:
- ✅ Only 1 active PSYCHOLOGIST user
- ✅ ≤ 50 active patients
- ✅ ≤ 2 GB storage used
- ✅ No dependencies on PRO-only features

**Process**:
1. System checks constraints
2. If violations exist, show blocker:
   - "You have 3 psychologists. Deactivate 2 to downgrade."
   - "You have 75 patients. Archive 25 to downgrade."
3. User resolves blockers
4. Downgrade scheduled for end of current billing period
5. PRO features locked on downgrade date
6. Credit applied to BASIC plan

**PRO-Only Feature Handling**:
- **Clinical notes**: Remain in database (read-only), not editable
- **Tasks**: Hidden from UI, data preserved
- **Attachments**: Downloads allowed, uploads blocked
- **Web Push**: Subscriptions disabled

#### PRO ← CUSTOM

**Allowed IF**:
- ✅ ≤ 15 active psychologists
- ✅ No active SSO users
- ✅ No webhook dependencies

**Process**:
1. Requires mutual agreement (contractual)
2. 30-day notice period
3. Migration assistance provided
4. Custom integrations deactivated
5. API access downgraded to read-only

### 3. Seat Management Rules

#### Adding a Psychologist

**Constraint Check**:
```typescript
function canAddPsychologist(tenant: Tenant): boolean {
  const activePsychologists = tenant.users.filter(
    u => u.role === 'PSYCHOLOGIST' && u.status === 'ACTIVE'
  ).length;
  
  const plan = tenant.subscription.plan;
  
  if (plan.tier === 'BASIC') {
    return activePsychologists < 1; // Max 1
  }
  
  if (plan.tier === 'PRO') {
    return activePsychologists < 15; // Max 15
  }
  
  if (plan.tier === 'CUSTOM') {
    return activePsychologists < plan.customLimits.maxPsychologists;
  }
  
  return false;
}
```

**Enforcement Point**: `inviteUser()` API endpoint

**UX Flow** (if limit reached):
1. User clicks "Invite Psychologist"
2. Backend returns 403: "Seat limit reached"
3. Frontend shows modal:
   - "You've reached your plan limit (1 psychologist)"
   - "Upgrade to PRO to add more psychologists"
   - [Upgrade to PRO] button → `/admin/subscription?action=upgrade`

#### Deactivating a Psychologist

**Allowed**: Always (frees up a seat)

**Process**:
1. Psychologist status → INACTIVE
2. Seat count decrements immediately
3. User loses access immediately
4. Billing adjusts next cycle (no refund for partial month)
5. Appointments remain assigned (historical data)

**Reactivating**:
- Requires available seat capacity
- Same constraint check as new invite

### 4. Patient Limit Rules

#### Adding a Patient

**Constraint Check**:
```typescript
function canAddPatient(tenant: Tenant): boolean {
  const activePatients = tenant.patients.filter(
    p => p.status === 'ACTIVE'
  ).length;
  
  const limit = tenant.subscription.plan.limits.maxPatients;
  
  return activePatients < limit;
}
```

**Enforcement**: 
- **Hard block** at 100% of limit (after grace period)
- **Soft warning** at 80% of limit

**UX Flow** (at 80%):
- Banner: "You're using 40/50 patient slots. Upgrade to PRO for 500 patients."
- Dismissible for 7 days

**UX Flow** (at 100% after grace):
1. User clicks "New Patient"
2. Modal: "Patient limit reached (50/50)"
3. Options:
   - [Archive inactive patients] → Patient archive flow
   - [Upgrade to PRO] → `/admin/subscription?action=upgrade`

### 5. Storage Limit Rules

#### File Upload

**Constraint Check**:
```typescript
function canUploadFile(tenant: Tenant, fileSizeBytes: number): boolean {
  const currentUsageGB = tenant.subscription.usage.storageUsedGB;
  const limitGB = tenant.subscription.plan.limits.storageGB;
  const newUsageGB = currentUsageGB + (fileSizeBytes / 1e9);
  
  return newUsageGB <= limitGB;
}
```

**Enforcement**: Immediate hard block

**UX Flow**:
1. User uploads file
2. Frontend checks size against remaining quota (optimistic)
3. Backend validates
4. If rejected (413 Payload Too Large):
   - Toast: "Storage limit reached. Delete files or upgrade."
   - Link to storage management page
   - Link to upgrade

### 6. Notification Limit Rules

#### Sending Notification

**Constraint Check**:
```typescript
function canSendNotification(
  tenant: Tenant,
  type: 'email' | 'push' | 'sms'
): boolean {
  const usage = tenant.subscription.usage;
  const limits = tenant.subscription.plan.limits;
  
  switch (type) {
    case 'email':
      return usage.emailsSentThisMonth < limits.maxEmailsPerMonth;
    case 'push':
      return usage.pushSentThisMonth < limits.maxPushPerMonth;
    case 'sms':
      return usage.smsSentThisMonth < limits.maxSmsPerMonth;
  }
}
```

**Enforcement**: 
- **Queue** notifications if limit reached
- **Send** on 1st of next month

**UX Flow**:
- No user-facing error (transparent)
- Admin dashboard shows: "Email notifications paused (limit reached). Resets on March 1."

## 🔄 MIGRATION & EDGE CASES

### Edge Case 1: Downgrade with Active PRO Features

**Scenario**: User wants BASIC but has clinical notes

**Solution**:
1. **Check Dependencies**:
   ```typescript
   function checkDowngradeConstraints(tenant: Tenant): Constraint[] {
     const violations = [];
     
     if (hasClinicalNotes(tenant)) {
       violations.push({
         feature: 'Clinical Notes',
         count: getClinicalNotesCount(tenant),
         action: 'Data will become read-only (preserved but not editable)'
       });
     }
     
     return violations;
   }
   ```

### Edge Case 2: Reactivating Suspended Account

### Edge Case 3: Rapid Seat Fluctuation

**Scenario**: User adds 5 psychologists, then removes 3 within same billing period

**Billing Logic**:
- **Day 1**: Add 5 seats → Prorated charge
- **Day 10**: Remove 3 seats → Credit applied to account, no refund
- **Next cycle**: Billed for 2 additional seats only

**No immediate refund, credit accumulates for future bills**
